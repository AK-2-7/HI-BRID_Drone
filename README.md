# HI-BRID_Drone
my first project for github it is a drone project i am undertaking for college stuff...
the controlles are pretty basic and does not have the capabilities of driving or flying rn it can just transform into different modes.
- To intreact with this projec you will need WEBOTS.
- WEBOTS download link - https://cyberbotics.com/
- After the installation create a Folder for Project_Librairy
- Add the controller as well as the world (.wrt) flie in that folder
- open the world in WEBOTS with the controller
- change the controller from generic or none to the included controller file
- just run the simulation and watch it go..
